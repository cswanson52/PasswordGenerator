# Password Generator

## Description

In this project I used JavaScript to create a random password. Using confirm and prompt I ask the user to select from different character types to use in a password and to set the character length. I then take their input and validate it through if statements and loops. Once the password is generated you can see the random password within the box on the page. I also added the empty variables within the function so if the user wanted a different password the current password would be cleared. 

## Installation

- Clone repository to local drive
- Open using editor of choice to view code
- To view site from editor, right click inside editor and select 'View in Default Browser'.

## Usage

To use the password generator:

- Start by clicking the "Generate Password" button
- Select the types of charcters from the prompts that appear at the top of the page. Choose from lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters and numbers.
- In the last prompt, you are asked how many charcters you would like your password to be. Choose from 8 to 128 characters and enter your answer in the box provided. 
- Your random password will appear in the dotted box.
